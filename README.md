# UTK_OF_Condenser
Condenses a folder of OpenFace output files into a merged file with only the relevant information. Tuned to work with the UTK face dataset, though it would be easy to generalize.

You should be able to run this directly, right out of the box. If you run Mac and this breaks, it is probably because of filepath concatenation shortcuts. I plan to fix this in the future. Cheers!
