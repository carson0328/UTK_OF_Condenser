# UTK_OF_Condenser
Condenses a folder of OpenFace output files into a merged file with only the relevant information. Tuned to work with the UTK face dataset, though it would be easy to generalize.

You should be able to run this directly, right out of the box. Currently it only works on Windows because of how I approached filepaths. I will update it to work for Mac too in the future (was an oversight).
